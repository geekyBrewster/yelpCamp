Based on the project that is part of the Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele. I'll be using this project to review the creation of a Javascript full stack application, which will include using Javascript templates, authentication and a user comment system. I'll be using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB.

## Technologies Used
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript
- EJS (Embedded JS) for Javascript template
- Node.js & Express
- PostgreSQL
